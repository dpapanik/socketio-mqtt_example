# socketio-mqtt_example
This repository is a simple example of combining a socket.io server and a socket.io client with a mqtt client in order to remotely control an Arduino MKR GSM 1400 through the internet, using CloudMQTT as an mqtt broker. This repo includes also the Arduino MKR1400 code. The example allows a user to control the Arduino from the web browser.
